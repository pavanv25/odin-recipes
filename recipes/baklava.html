        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Thaw the dough:</strong> Thaw the phyllo dough according to manufacturer's directions (this may take overnight).</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven and prep the pan:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the filling, melt the butter, and prep the dough:</strong> In a food processor, pulse the nuts until they are finely chopped. Combine with the sugar, cinnamon, and cloves. In a separate bowl, melt the butter in the microwave. Roll out the phyllo sheets and cut in half so the sheets will fit in the pan.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the first layer:</strong> Place a sheet of phyllo dough into the pan. Using a pastry brush, brush the phyllo sheet with melted butter. Repeat 7 more times until it is 8 sheets thick, each sheet being "painted" with the butter.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the filling and continue layering:</strong> Spoon on a thin layer of the nut mixture. Cover with two more sheets of phyllo, brushing each one with butter. Continue to repeat the nut mixture and two buttered sheets of phyllo until the nut mixture is all used up. The top layer should be 8 phyllo sheets thick, each sheet being individually buttered. Do not worry if the sheets crinkle up a bit, it will just add more texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Score, then bake:</strong> Score into 24 equal sized squares using a sharp knife. Bake at 350°F for 30 to 35 minutes or until lightly golden brown, and edges appear slightly crisp.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the syrup:</strong> While baking, make the syrup. Combine the cinnamon stick, sugar, lemon juice, honey, and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium low heat and let simmer for 7 minutes and slightly thickened. Remove the cinnamon stick and allow to cool.</li>
            <li><strong>Spoon the syrup over the hot bakalava:</strong> Spoon the cooled syrup over the hot baklava and let cool, uncovered, for at least 4 hours.Garnish with some finely crushed pistachios of desired.</li>
        </ol>
